## Laravel Boilerplate
# This is a basic boilerplate code to structure your laravel frontend. To get rid of repeated code, you just need to install this project and need to add dependencies based on your project. Frontend would be anything like blade, livewire, filament or shopify.

## for frontend like vue and react basic boilerplate code is not added as in most of production based projects repo of frontend and backend are different, so need to consider vue and react for this setup.
